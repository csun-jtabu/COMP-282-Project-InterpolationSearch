# COMP-282-Project-InterpolationSearch
COMP 282 Project:

Team 1: Jaztin Tabunda and Gerardo Marioni

Topic/Algorithm: Using Interpolation Search to search CSUN's
Faculty/Administration Catalog

New tentative perspective of plan: Finding a quicker way to search for CSUN Professors


UPDATES:
9-26-2021: 
Got the Base Algorithm of Interpolation Search to somewhat work with Strings. Compares the first Character of each string in an array.
Will need to update with a loop of some sort to traverse each character in the array's string. - Jaztin 




Plans:
- Perfect the interpolation search to return the exact name in the array (Possibly using for loops to traverse array and string characters)
- Gather Data from CSUN's Web Page of Professors and put it on a txt file
- Create a class of Professors and enter in an array (Possible Attributes: Office Hours)
- Make a menu that searches for the Professor by name or by office hours


Quick Tracking of Contributions:
  
  Jaztin:
- Created/Provided Base Program/Algorithm
- Customized Program in the direction to the general plan
- Made Github Page for Project
- Collected 30 Data samples of Professors 
first name, last name, days they are available, hours they are available, department
- Made Interpolation Search method which utilizes interpolation search to find
the professor based on the first name only.
- Made file containing the data samples.
- Adjusted Interpolation Search to fit with Gerardo's arraylist and node methods
- Made sumArrayWChar method to fit with Interpolation search
- Made a loop to insert the collected data into data fields and inserted into the Node
- Debugged Gerardo's NameArrayList Class file to fit with my interpolation search method
